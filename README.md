# Text Encryption and Decryption

## Overview
This is a **Tkinter-based GUI application** for encrypting and decrypting messages using the **Vigenère cipher** along with **Base64 encoding**. The application allows users to securely encode and decode messages by entering a secret key.

## Features
- **Encrypts messages** using the Vigenère cipher with Base64 encoding.
- **Decrypts messages** back to plaintext using the same key.
- **User-friendly GUI** built with Tkinter.
- **Reset and Exit options** for convenience.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **Tkinter** (GUI Toolkit)
- **Base64 Encoding**
